Release notes
*************


Version 2.1.3
=============

Release: 2016-09-01

* Fix broken CSV table output style

* Fix "jube_wp_..." parameter handling bug, if these parameter are
  used inside another script parameter

* Added new optional argument "suffix="..."" to the "<step>" tag

     * Parameter are allowed inside this argument string.

     * The evaluated string will be attached to the default
       workpackage directory name to allow users to find specific
       directories in an easier way (e.g. "000001_stepname_suffix" ).

* The *XML* schema files can now be found inside the "contrib"
  folder

* Added new advanced error handling

     * JUBE will not stop any more if an error occurs inside a "run"
       or "continue". The error will be marked and the corresponding
       workpackage will not be touched anymore.

     * There is also a "-e"/"--exit" option to overwrite this
       behaviour to directly exit if there is an error.


Version 2.1.2
=============

Release: 2016-07-29

* The internal parameter handling is much faster now, especially if
  a large number of parameter is used within the same step.

* Fix critical bug when storing environment variables. Environment
  variables wasn't read correctly inside a step if this step was only
  executed after a "jube continue" run.

* Fix bug inside a "<sub>" if it contains any linebreak

* Quotes are added automatically inside the "$jube_wp_envstr"
  variable to support spaces in the environment variable argument list

* Combining "-u" and "tags" in a "jube result" run will not filter
  the result branches anymore

* Allow lowercase "false" in bool expressions (e.g. the "active"
  option)

* Fix bug when using *JUBE* in a *Python3.x* environment

* The "jube help" output was restructed to display separate key
  columns instead of a keyword list

* "<pattern>" can now contain a "default=..." attribute which set
  their default value if the pattern can't be found or if it can't be
  evaluated

* "null_value=..." was removed from the "<column>" and "<key>"-tag
  because the new default attribute matches its behaviour

* Added first *JUBE* FAQ entries to the documentation: *Frequently
  Asked Questions*

* New "active"-attribute inside a "<step>"-tag. The attribute
  enables or disables the corresponding step (and all following
  steps). It can contain any bool expression and available parameter.

* Fix bug in "<link>" handling if an alternative link name is used
  which points to a sub directory

* Added new option "-c / --csv-parametrization" to "jube info"
  command to show a workpackage specfic parametrisation by using the
  CSV format (similar to the existing "-p" option)

* Allow Shell expansion in "<link>" tags. "<link>" now also support
  the "*"

* Restructure internal "<copy>" and "<link>" handling

* All example platform files were updated an simplified


Version 2.1.1
=============

Release: 2016-04-14

* *JUBE* will now show only the latest benchmark result by default,
  " --id all" must be used to see all results

* Bool expressions can now be used directly in the "<do active="">"
  attribute

* Added "filter" attribute in "<table>" and "<syslog>" to show only
  specifix result entries (based on a bool expression)

* New "<parameter>" and "<pattern>" mode: "mode="shell""

* Allow multiline output in result tables

* Fix wrong group handling if "JUBE_GROUP_NAME" is used

* Scripting parameter (e.g. "mode="python"") can now handle $ to
  allow access to environment variables

* Fix $$ bug ($$ were ignored when used within a parameter)

* Fix "$jube_wp_parent_..._id" bug if "$jube_wp_parent_..._id" is
  used within another parameter

* Fix bug in std calculation when creating statistical result values

* Fix bug if tags are used within "<include>"

=============

Release: 2015-11-10

* Fix slow verbose mode

* New "transpose="true"" attribute possible in "<table>"

* Allow recursive parameter name creation in "<do>" or "<sub>" (e.g.
  "${param${num}}")

* Extend iteration feature

  * "iteration=#number" can be used in the "<step>" tag, the work
    package will be executed #number times

  * New "reduce" attribute in analyser, possible values: "true" or
    "false" (default: "true")

    * "true": use a single result line to combine all iterations

    * "false": each iteration will get its separate result line

* Fix pattern_cnt bug

* "reduce" option in "<pattern>" not needed anymore (all possible
  reduce options are now calculated automatically)

* New version numbering model to divide between feature and bugfix
  releases

* New environment variable "JUBE_GROUP_NAME": By setting and
  exporting "JUBE_GROUP_NAME" to an available UNIX group, *JUBE* will
  create benchmark directory structures which can be accessed by the
  given group.

* Benchmark results can now be created also by user without write-
  access to the benchmark directory
