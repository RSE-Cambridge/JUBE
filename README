Prerequisites:

JUBE version 2 is written in the Python programming language.

You need Python 2.7 or Python 3.2 (or a higher version) to run the program.

You also can use Python 2.6 to run JUBE. In this case you had to add the 
argparse-module (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/argparse) to your Python module 
library on your own.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installation:

After download unpack the distribution file JUBE-<version>.tar.gz with:

>>> tar -xf JUBE-<version>.tar.gz

You can install the files to your $HOME/.local directory by using:

>>> cd JUBE-<version>

>>> python setup.py install --user

$HOME/.local/bin must be inside your $PATH environment variable to use 
JUBE in an easy way.

To check the installation you can run:

>>> jube --version

Without the --user argument, JUBE will be installed in the standard 
system path for Python packages.
